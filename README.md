 # MHistory
# Purpose of the application 
My application's main goal is to give users a distinctive and captivating experience that revolves on historical individuals and their lives. Users will be able to enter their age onto the programme, which will start a retrieval process matching them with famous people who have died at that similar age. In addition to this feature, the app will provide users with succinct yet educational biographies of these great personalities, providing context for their accomplishments, legacies, and lifestyles.
Additionally, I will use GitHub as a single hub for version control and continuous integration to guarantee the application's dependability and smooth operation. The codebase will be put through automated testing processes using GitHub Actions, which will thoroughly examine its functioning in a variety of scenarios and contexts.  In the event of any discrepancies or faults detected during these tests, GitHub Actions will promptly notify me, enabling swift remediation and ensuring a robust and dependable user experience. By harnessing the power of GitHub and its suite of development tools, I aim to deliver an application that not only entertains and educates but also upholds the highest standards of reliability and performance. 
# Design considerations 
The application's user interface is painstakingly designed to both pique the user's curiosity and guarantee seamless operation. It has all the necessary parts to work smoothly, such two large buttons that are positioned to be easily accessible by the user. While the "Clear" button provides a quick way to remove input data without having to deal with the inconvenience of manual deletion, the "Calculate" button acts as the spark plug for processing user input and producing pertinent information. A simple text input area that allows visitors to easily enter their age is combined with a text view that is carefully structured to display information about the chosen celebrity along with a brief synopsis.
An image component is carefully incorporated to improve user engagement and aesthetic appeal. It enriches the interface with eye-catching pictures and strengthens the link with the historical personalities under study. The application's development is based on the Kotlin programming language, which offers a stable and adaptable framework for adding functionality and guaranteeing cross-platform compatibility.
Apart from its essential features, the programme has strong error management systems to guarantee a smooth user experience. In the unlikely event that a user enters their age and no well-known person has died at that same age, the programme quickly recognises this circumstance and displays a well constructed error message. The purpose of this message is to gently notify the user that there are no historical figures that match the input they have provided. Through proactive resolution of these kinds of situations, the application promotes transparency and clarity, providing users with pertinent feedback and assisting them as they navigate their interaction journey. By means of careful error management, the application strives to maintain its dedication to user satisfaction and usability, guaranteeing that each and every interaction with the interface is clear, educational, and free from confusion or frustration.
Using internet connectivity, the application dynamically retrieves details about the chosen historical figure from the internet, utilizing online resources to provide users with a thorough understanding of the person's background, achievements, and significance. By utilizing conditional logic, if statements are implemented in a way that simplifies the logic flow and speeds up the coding process. This improves the readability and maintainability of the code. This methodology guarantees that the application maintains its intuitiveness, responsiveness, and user-friendliness, providing a captivating interface that skillfully combines practicality and visual appeal.
# Utilisation of github and github actions 
To make sure my code works on more platforms than just my local machine, I'll be using GitHub Actions to expedite the testing process. Through the use of GitHub Actions, I want to confirm that the program runs without a hitch on my PC as well as a variety of other computers, including mobile devices. Furthermore, GitHub is a great resource for preserving the application's dependability and guaranteeing a positive user experience. It fosters continuous improvement by offering a collaborative area where problems can be recorded, defects can be reported, and upgrades can be offered. Furthermore, GitHub will be essential in providing thorough reports that outline the application's goals and features. These reports will elucidate the application's objectives, features, and implementation procedures, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding for both developers and end-users alike. Through GitHub's robust capabilities, I aim to enhance the reliability, usability, and transparency of the application, ultimately enriching the overall development and user experience.
# conclusion
To sum up, the program I created seeks to provide users an immersive historical experience by letting them enter their age and finding illustrious historical persons who died at that similar age. Along with providing a window into the lives of these characters, it also uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and integration, guaranteeing dependability and flawless performance. The carefully designed user interface includes minimalist design elements, eye-catching graphics, and necessary functions like the "Calculate" and "Clear" buttons for user-friendliness. When there are no historical figures that match the user's input, robust error handling procedures ensure a seamless user experience. By taking advantage of internet connectivity, the program dynamically retrieves details about the chosen historical personalities, enhancing users' comprehension of their biographies and relevance. Conditional logic and the Kotlin programming language make coding more efficient and improve readability and maintainability of the code. All things considered, the application aims to provide a captivating and educational experience while maintaining the greatest levels of dependability, usability, and user happiness. Throughout time, the application seeks to improve and enhance the user experience through continuous improvement made possible by GitHub.
